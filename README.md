## Setup/Installation Requirements

To install this repository into a new project each time, first

* Clone the github repository using the git clone command from /Desktop
* Create a new folder in the Desktop with your project name
* Copy and paste the entire contents of the cloned /javascript-template into your new folder (this should not include the .pairs file)
* Move into your new folder and initialize git as normal
* ``` $ npm install ``` to pull dependencies listed in package.json

Some **DONT'S**

* Don't just rename the cloned git repository - that will mess up future commits.  Do the copy/paste

## Known Bugs
